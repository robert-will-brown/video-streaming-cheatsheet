## Adding Terminology

If you don't have time to write a PR, just copy and paste the term into an issue - we will add it.

### Guidelines

This is designed to be a cheatsheet, that is, information that will *always* fit physically on a single piece of paper.  

As there is only a small amount of space usable on a double sided page, please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Be ruthless with the length of entries. They must be as succinct as possible so don't use twelve words if three will suffice. It's okay (often preferable) to use non "English grammar" sentence structure to honour this rule.
- Ensure that an entry is focussed on the Streaming Video Industry specifically.
- Use acronyms when referring to other terms in the list (ðŸ‘‡).
- *Italicise* acronyms with a `\textit{Some Acronym}`.
- End the terms in full stops `.` -  we aren't animals...
